            <p class="article-text">
                Sushi rice, known as <strong>“shari”</strong> or <strong>“sumeshi”</strong> in Japanese, is the
                foundation of nearly every sushi dish. The taste and texture of sushi depend heavily on how the rice is
                cooked, seasoned, and cooled. Even the simplest roll or nigiri can only shine when the rice is prepared
                correctly. This guide will help you understand each step to achieve well-balanced, glossy, and flavorful
                sushi rice at home — with techniques that have been used for generations in Japanese kitchens.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Understanding the Role of Sushi Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                In traditional Japanese cuisine, rice is more than just a side dish; it represents purity, harmony, and
                balance. Sushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which naturally contains a higher level
                of starch than long-grain varieties. This starch gives sushi rice its signature stickiness and soft
                texture, helping it hold its shape when molded or rolled. Getting this right ensures the rice
                complements the fresh toppings or fillings used in sushi.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Ingredients You’ll Need</h3>
            <ul class="article-text">
                <li>2 cups short-grain Japanese rice</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups water (for cooking)</li>
                <li>¼ cup rice vinegar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 1: Washing the Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Washing is one of the most essential steps. The goal is to remove excess surface starch from the grains.
                Place the rice in a large bowl, add cold water, and gently wash it by swirling your hand through the
                grains. The first rinse will appear cloudy — drain it completely. Repeat this process about 4–5 times
                until the water runs almost clear. This ensures that the rice cooks evenly without becoming gummy.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 2: Soaking Before Cooking</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                After washing, soak the rice in clean water for 20–30 minutes. Soaking allows the grains to absorb
                moisture evenly, leading to a softer and more uniform texture after cooking. This is especially
                important if you are using an electric rice cooker, as it helps maintain consistent results.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 3: Cooking the Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Use a rice cooker for the best consistency, though a heavy pot works fine as well. Combine the rinsed
                rice and the measured water. If cooking on the stove, bring the water to a gentle boil over medium heat,
                then reduce to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it steam (still
                covered) for another 10 minutes. This resting phase is key for an even, fluffy texture.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 4: Preparing the Sushi Vinegar</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                While the rice cooks, prepare the vinegar seasoning known as <em>sushi-zu</em>. Mix rice vinegar, sugar,
                and salt in a small saucepan over low heat until dissolved — do not boil. The mixture should taste mild
                and slightly tangy. The balance between sweet and sour defines how subtle or strong the final sushi rice
                flavor will be.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 5: Seasoning the Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Transfer the cooked rice to a large wooden, glass, or plastic bowl (avoid metal, as it reacts with
                vinegar). Pour the warm vinegar mixture evenly over the rice. Using a rice paddle or flat spatula,
                gently cut through the rice in a slicing motion — avoid stirring or pressing. The goal is to mix while
                maintaining the integrity of the grains.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 6: Cooling the Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Cooling sushi rice correctly is what gives it that glossy, slightly sticky texture. Traditionally, a
                hand fan is used to cool the rice quickly while mixing. This helps evaporate excess moisture and gives
                the rice a pleasant sheen. Once it reaches room temperature, cover it with a damp cloth to prevent
                drying.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 7: Testing the Texture</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Perfect sushi rice should be slightly warm to the touch, moist but not wet, and each grain should hold
                its shape. When you press it gently between your fingers, it should stick together without feeling
                mushy. Achieving this balance may take a little practice, but the results are worth it.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
            <ul class="article-text">
                <li>Skipping the washing step — leads to overly sticky or uneven rice.</li>
                <li>Using the wrong type of vinegar — rice vinegar gives a mild, balanced flavor.</li>
                <li>Overmixing — can break the grains and create a pasty texture.</li>
                <li>Not cooling the rice properly — affects texture and appearance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Storing Sushi Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Sushi rice is best used fresh, ideally within a few hours. If needed, it can be kept at room temperature
                for up to 6 hours, covered with a damp cloth. Avoid refrigerating, as it causes the rice to harden and
                lose its stickiness. The best sushi rice feels soft and flavorful, enhancing whatever toppings or
                fillings it accompanies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Bringing It All Together</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Preparing sushi rice is a practice that rewards patience and attention to detail. Each step — from
                washing and soaking to seasoning and cooling — plays a role in achieving the perfect texture. Once you
                get comfortable with this process, you can use your rice for nigiri, maki rolls, or chirashi bowls with
                confidence. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned home cook, mastering sushi rice is a rewarding way
                to appreciate the harmony and balance that define Japanese cuisine.
