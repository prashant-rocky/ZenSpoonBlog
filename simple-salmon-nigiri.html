            <p class="article-text">
                Salmon nigiri is one of the most popular forms of sushi — a delicate combination of lightly seasoned
                rice and fresh slices of salmon. Known for its elegant simplicity, this dish celebrates the balance of
                flavor, texture, and presentation that defines Japanese cuisine. In this step-by-step guide, you’ll
                learn how to prepare salmon nigiri at home using accessible ingredients and careful technique, all while
                honoring the traditional approach.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">What is Salmon Nigiri?</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Nigiri is a type of sushi consisting of a small hand-shaped portion of sushi rice topped with a slice of
                fish. “Nigiri” comes from the Japanese word meaning “to grasp” or “to hold,” which reflects the way the
                rice is molded by hand. Salmon nigiri pairs the mild richness of salmon with vinegared rice, creating a
                clean and balanced flavor that’s easy to enjoy for beginners and experienced sushi lovers alike.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Ingredients You’ll Need</h3>
            <ul class="article-text">
                <li>Fresh salmon (sashimi-grade, thinly sliced)</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups sushi rice (cooked and seasoned)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar (for hand shaping)</li>
                <li>Wasabi (optional, for layering)</li>
                <li>Soy sauce (for dipping)</li>
                <li>Pickled ginger (for cleansing the palate)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 1: Prepare the Sushi Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                The base of nigiri is sushi rice seasoned with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Make sure the
                rice is slightly warm but not hot when shaping. It should be sticky enough to hold its shape without
                clumping. If you need help making perfect sushi rice, refer to your earlier guide on “How to Make
                Perfect Sushi Rice Every Time.”
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 2: Prepare the Salmon</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Use fresh, sashimi-grade salmon for safety and best texture. Slice the salmon against the grain into
                thin pieces, around 2–3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Each slice should be smooth and even to lay neatly
                on top of the rice. Keep the salmon chilled until ready to assemble to maintain freshness.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 3: Shaping the Rice</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Moisten your hands lightly with a mix of water and a touch of rice vinegar to prevent sticking. Take a
                small portion of rice (about the size of a ping-pong ball) and gently shape it into an oval using your
                fingers. The rice should be firm enough to hold its form but soft enough to remain airy inside.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 4: Assembling the Nigiri</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Place a thin layer of wasabi (if using) on one side of the salmon slice. Lay the salmon on top of the
                shaped rice, wasabi side down. Press lightly with two fingers to secure the fish onto the rice. The
                pressure should be gentle — just enough to make them hold together without compressing the grains.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Step 5: Presentation and Serving</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Arrange the finished salmon nigiri pieces neatly on a plate. Traditional presentation includes serving
                with soy sauce on the side and a small portion of pickled ginger for cleansing the palate between bites.
                The beauty of nigiri lies in its simplicity — each piece is crafted to highlight the balance between
                rice and fish.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Tips for Perfect Nigiri</h3>
            <ul class="article-text compare-list">
                <li><strong>Use sashimi-grade fish:</strong> Always choose fish that is specifically prepared for raw
                    consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Work with warm rice:</strong> Slightly warm rice adheres better to the fish than cold rice.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Keep your hands clean and damp:</strong> This prevents the rice from sticking while shaping.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gentle pressure:</strong> Press lightly when forming nigiri to maintain the rice’s texture.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                One common error is pressing the rice too tightly, which makes the nigiri dense. Another is using rice
                that’s too dry or overcooled — it won’t hold its shape well. Finally, ensure that each salmon slice
                covers the rice completely but does not hang over excessively; proportion is key to traditional
                presentation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Making It at Home</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Making salmon nigiri at home can be a fun and rewarding experience. It helps you understand the
                importance of balance in Japanese cooking — from seasoning rice to handling fish gently. With practice,
                shaping nigiri becomes easier, and you’ll develop a feel for the right texture and size.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Storing and Serving Tips</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Salmon nigiri is best enjoyed immediately after preparation. If needed, it can be kept in a cool place
                for a short time before serving, but avoid refrigeration as it can harden the rice and change the
                texture of the fish. Always prepare the exact number of pieces you plan to serve for the freshest
                experience.
            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title mt-4">Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
                Salmon nigiri represents the heart of Japanese sushi-making — a blend of simplicity, precision, and
                respect for ingredients. With a few quality components and careful technique, you can create an elegant
                dish that reflects the true essence of Japanese home dining. Practice slowly, enjoy the process, and
                each piece you shape will bring you closer to mastering this timeless dish.
